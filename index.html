     I am currently in my junior year at towers high school. I like to play sports like basketball and softball, I am currently learning aboutt
     software of technology. I am from birmangham alabama, I live in Altanata georgia now. My favorite subject is biology. I am currently learning
     to watch over my life of choices as in my grades, and what I want to do after high school or in school now. The school I want to go to after
     high school is gerorgia state. The reason because the school looks intersting and probably a good environment for me. But I also have other
     interst of schools but that is my main one i want to intend.

     I had considered to play vollyball, but I figured out that my favorite sport is basketball.

    My favorite favorite acitivites is mostly going out learning new things like sports or other things. My favorite color is baby blue and green. 
    my least favorite subject is world history and algebra. I like learning new things trying new things that I never done before just ti get out my
    confront zone I guess. What I learned about myself is that I have interst and dislikes and mostly it comes from either from expresience's or just 
    from what I was told from people or heard.
